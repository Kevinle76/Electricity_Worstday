# Electricity_Worstday
In this activity, we will take a dataset on San Francisco Airport's utility consumption and determine which day in the dataset had the worst consumption for each utility.

## Problems:

* Print out a list of all the values within the "Utility" column.

* Select a value from this list, and create a new DataFrame that only includes that utility. Note that some utilities have more than one option for "Owner," and we may want to limit this new DataFrame to a single "Owner."
